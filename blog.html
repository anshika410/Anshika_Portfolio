                "Blogging is a great way for students to express themselves in a safe online environment.
                Not only does it work to build creativity and self-expression, 
                it can be downright fun to have your voice heard.The world is so careful about internet safety 
                that you wouldn't think that blogging would be a tool to expand a student's mind. 
                However, blogging can provide several benefits".

                "Student blogging gives them a platform to explore their feelings about a topic. 
                While it is often an educational topic, the students still know others will read it. 
                The fact that they are providing information to others will give them a need to create 
                good information since it opens them to criticism.

                Blogs can also let students explore areas that they really enjoy, like fashion or art. 
                By sharing their thoughts, they are learning how to express themselves to the world.
                Some of the best blogs for students to read are those written by fellow students in similar 
                situations or with similar interests".
